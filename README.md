# Relationship Between Air Pollution and Respiratory Health

![Air Pollution and Health](https://path/to/your/image.jpg)

## Introduction
Air pollution has become a significant public health concern globally, particularly in urban areas. Exposure to pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) has been linked to increased rates of respiratory diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer. This project investigates the correlation between air pollution levels and respiratory disease mortality across several countries over time, using statistical analysis techniques in R.

## Problem Statement
The project aims to assess the extent to which air pollution affects respiratory health. Specifically, it examines whether higher levels of air pollution correlate with increased mortality rates from respiratory diseases, with implications for public health and environmental policy.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Preprocessed datasets in Excel and imported them to R.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Calculated descriptive statistics and performed regression analysis to investigate relationships.
- **Data Visualization:** Generated scatter plots, box plots, and regression models to illustrate findings.

## Data Overview
The datasets used in this analysis were sourced from Kaggle and included:
1. **Pollution Data** – Measurements of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 levels over multiple years and countries.
2. **Mortality Data** – Annual mortality rates from respiratory diseases, focusing on asthma, COPD, and lung cancer.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** The raw data was cleaned in Excel to remove missing and duplicated values and then imported into R.
2. **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculated means, medians, standard deviations, and variances for pollutant levels and mortality rates.
3. **Regression Analysis:** Conducted regression to assess the impact of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 levels on mortality from respiratory diseases.
4. **Visualization:** Created scatter and box plots to visualize the relationship between pollutant levels and mortality rates.

## Results and Analysis
- **Descriptive Statistics:** PM10 showed the highest concentration levels, while mortality rates were highest in areas with elevated NO2 levels.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Positive correlations were found between pollutant levels and respiratory disease mortality, especially with NO2 and COPD/lung cancer mortality.
- **Regression Analysis:** NO2 had the most significant positive association with respiratory disease mortality, indicating a need for focused emission reductions.

### Visualizations
- **Scatter Plots:** Displayed positive trends between pollutants and respiratory deaths.
- **Box Plots:** Showed broader distributions in respiratory mortality in countries with high PM levels.

## Conclusion
The analysis indicates that NO2 significantly impacts respiratory disease mortality, especially for chronic conditions like COPD and lung cancer. This highlights the importance of reducing NO2 emissions through stricter regulations.

## Recommendations
- Implementing stricter air quality standards for NO2 and PM10 in high-risk areas.
- Developing public health policies focused on respiratory health in heavily polluted regions.
- Further research to explore the long-term effects of PM2.5 and interactions between various pollutants.
